# Documentation Plan for OLX Clone

This document outlines the plan for creating comprehensive documentation for the OLX clone application. The goal is to provide clear, concise, and up-to-date information for developers, maintainers, and future contributors.

## 1. Project Overview

*   **README.md**: Update the main README to include a high-level overview of the project, its purpose, key features, and technologies used.
*   **Architecture Overview**: A document (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE.md`) describing the overall system architecture, including frontend (React), backend (Node.js/Express), database (MongoDB), and any other services.

## 2. Frontend Documentation (React)

*   **Component Documentation**:
    *   For each major component (e.g., `ProductCard`, `Header`, `Login`, `Signup`), add comments explaining its purpose, props, state, and any significant logic.
    *   Consider using JSDoc or similar for better IDE integration and potential auto-generation of documentation.
*   **State Management (Zustand)**: Document the global state structure, actions, and selectors. Explain how to add new state slices and interact with the store.
*   **Data Fetching (React Query)**: Document the usage of React Query, including query keys, mutations, and cache invalidation strategies.
*   **Form Handling (React Hook Form & Zod)**: Explain how forms are built, validated, and submitted using React Hook Form and Zod schemas.
*   **Styling (Tailwind CSS)**: Briefly explain the Tailwind CSS setup and how to apply styles.
*   **Folder Structure**: Document the purpose of key folders within `react-app/src`.

## 3. Backend Documentation (Node.js/Express)

*   **API Endpoints**:
    *   Document all API endpoints (e.g., `/api/products`, `/api/auth/login`).
    *   Include HTTP method, URL, request body (if any, with Zod schema reference), response body, and error codes.
    *   Consider using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.
*   **Authentication & Authorization**: Document the authentication flow (JWT), middleware, and authorization checks.
*   **Database Models**: Document the Mongoose schemas for `User` and `Product` models, including fields, types, and relationships.
*   **Controllers**: Explain the logic within each controller (e.g., `authController.js`, `productController.js`).
*   **Middleware**: Document custom middleware functions.
*   **Folder Structure**: Document the purpose of key folders within `node-app`.

## 4. Deployment Documentation

*   **Azure Deployment Guide**: A detailed step-by-step guide (e.g., `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md`) on how to deploy the application to Azure Cloud.
    *   Prerequisites (Azure CLI, Docker, etc.)
    *   Setting up Azure resources (App Service, Container Registry, MongoDB Atlas/Cosmos DB)
    *   Dockerizing the application (if not already done)
    *   CI/CD pipeline setup (GitHub Actions for Azure)
    *   Environment variables configuration.
*   **Docker Compose**: Document the `docker-compose.yml` file and how to run the application locally using Docker.

## 5. Development & Contribution Guide

*   **Getting Started**: Instructions for setting up the development environment locally.
*   **Running Tests**: How to run frontend and backend tests.
*   **Code Style & Linting**: Guidelines for code style and how to run linters.
*   **Contribution Guidelines**: How to contribute to the project (e.g., branching strategy, pull request process).

## 6. Tools & Technologies

*   List all major technologies used (React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Zustand, React Query, Zod, React Hook Form, Tailwind CSS, Docker, Azure).

## Next Steps

1.  Create `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
2.  Update `README.md`.
3.  Start adding inline comments to critical frontend and backend files.
4.  Begin drafting the `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md` based on the deployment strategy.
