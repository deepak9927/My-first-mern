## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Learning

1. **Start Small**: Don't try to do everything at once
2. **Read Code**: Study the existing components to understand patterns
3. **Use Docs**: Every guide has examples you can copy
4. **Test Often**: Test in the browser as you make changes
5. **Git Commits**: Commit after each working feature

### For Deployment

1. **Test Docker First**: Run `./test-docker.sh` before cloud deploy
2. **Use Free Tier**: Start with Azure F1 free tier
3. **Monitor Costs**: Set up budget alerts in Azure
4. **Backup .env**: Keep your environment variables safe
5. **SSL Included**: Azure provides free HTTPS certificates

### For Code Quality

1. **Follow Standards**: Use the patterns in `CODE_STANDARDS.md`
2. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript for new components
3. **Reuse Components**: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
4. **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully
5. **User Experience**: Think about loading states and feedback
